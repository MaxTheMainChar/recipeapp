  "//": "RecipeApp – Copilot project configuration",
  "context": [
    "This project is called RecipeApp.",
    "RecipeApp is a web app that generates cooking recipes from user-provided ingredients using an AI backend.",
    "The initial version is a simple MVP: user enters ingredients, clicks a single primary CTA, and sees 2–5 AI-generated recipes.",
    "Frontend is built as a React single-page app. Some UI components may be generated by v0.; Copilot should extend and integrate them, not rewrite them from scratch.",
    "The backend calls an OpenAI-compatible API for recipe generation.",
    "Design goals: simple, fast, no clutter, clear main action (Generate recipes), and results that are easy to read and follow."
  ],
  "rules": [
    "Use modern React with function components and hooks.",
    "Prefer composition over large monolithic components.",
    "Keep components focused: UI-only components should not contain business logic when avoidable.",
    "Use TypeScript if the existing project is in TypeScript; otherwise stay consistent with the current language.",
    "Do not commit API keys or secrets. Always read them from environment variables (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY) and never hard-code them.",
    "For styling, follow the existing approach in the project (Tailwind CSS or CSS-in-JS or plain CSS). If the project uses Tailwind utility classes, continue that pattern.",
    "Do not change v0-generated components unless necessary. Prefer to add new wrapper components, props, or composition instead of rewriting.",
    "When working on the recipe generation flow, assume a REST API endpoint like /api/generate-recipes that accepts JSON and returns JSON.",
    "Recipe objects should follow a consistent shape: { id, title, ingredients, steps, prepTimeMinutes, difficulty, estimatedCalories, tags } where ingredients and steps are arrays of strings.",
    "Handle loading, error, and empty states explicitly in UI components.",
    "Avoid unnecessary dependencies. Use the built-in Web APIs and React features where possible.",
    "Write small, named helper functions for repetitive logic (e.g., formatting ingredients, capitalizing labels).",
    "Prefer async/await over raw Promise chains.",
    "Validate user input lightly on the client (e.g., ignore empty ingredient strings, trim whitespace).",
    "Use semantic HTML elements where possible (button, form, main, section, header).",
    "Keep text strings user-friendly and concise; avoid technical jargon in UI copy.",
    "When introducing new files, use clear, descriptive names (e.g., RecipeCard.tsx, RecipeList.tsx, apiClient.ts).",
    "When in doubt, optimize for clarity and readability over cleverness."
